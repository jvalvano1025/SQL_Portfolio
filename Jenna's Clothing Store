/*In this project I create my own table regarding products at my made up clothing store and insert data into the table.
Addtionally, I draw some insights from the data I created by analyzing the clothing items by price (lowest to highest) to see which items
cost the least and which cost the most. I also look into the amount of total products I have on hand by getting the sum of the quantity
as well as the average price of the items in my store.*/
